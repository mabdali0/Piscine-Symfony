1. Download the Composer installation script :
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"

2. Check that the downloaded file has not been corrupted by comparing its hash with that provided by Composer :
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === file_get_contents('https://composer.github.io/installer.sig')) { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"

3. Install Composer :
php composer-setup.php

4. Delete the composer-setup.php file :
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

5. Making Composer globally accessible :
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

6. Check the installation :
composer -v
